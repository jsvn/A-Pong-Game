# Pong Game

My third project for REDAcademy involved creating a basic pong game using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript's ES6 syntax. This was a very interesting challenge, as it was part code along with the class, and part figure out the missing pieces. I thought it was a great opportunity to use the new syntax for ES6 and practice a more object oriented programming style with the newly added class functionality.

The main game functionality required we needed two independent instances of our Paddles to get them to move independently from each other on the below key presses, a way to count up a score for each side and mark it down on a scoreboard, and  also set the spacebar to start the ball's velocity at random intervals at the beginning and after each goal.

#How to Play:
## Keys

##### Player 1:
* a: up
* z: down

##### Player 2:
* ▲ : up
* ▼: down

##### Start
* space: start ball movement

## Some learnings
I learned a lot from completing this project. It challenged my problem-solving abilities and also really opened up my eyes to how precisely you need to be when telling a computer what to do.  I would like to try and finish up some of the stretch goals for this project, as well as try my hand at creating other simple games with code. I feel like my knowledge with javascript is growing, and every passing day I am feeling more comfortable with using the language. 

I have found through my first few projects here at RED that I really enjoy setting up the best dev environment that I can. I enjoy using/learning all the tools to utilize for being able to write more readable code on my end, while still producing files the browser can still read and render.
